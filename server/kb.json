    "long": "Hi there! I'm Hamza Musema. I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at Adama Science and Technology University. I love building tech solutions that actually make life easier. I mostly work with Flutter for mobile apps and Node.js with PostgreSQL for backends — I enjoy creating systems that connect everything smoothly from front to back. I've worked on several projects like Social Sync (a real‑time university communication platform), an online driving school system with video calls and payments, and a delivery app with live tracking. I'm also into AI, network systems, and exploring IoT technologies like Helium and Mysterium. When I'm not coding, I'm usually watching football, playing it, or checking out science and space movies. Overall, I'm someone who loves learning, building, and turning ideas into something real.",
